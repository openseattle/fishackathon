### Problem statement descriptions

With offshore fishing becoming more popular around the world, and crews encountering species we know little about but are economically important, it’s important to collect specific data that will benefit the fisheries. Even some of the most experienced crews may not always recognize what species of fish they encounter, or their size. Currently, there isn't a truly accurate solution that isn’t lethal. Crews currently land the fish and use an equation to measure size - square the girth of the fish and multiply by length and then divide by 800. Tens of thousands of people are involved in the fishing industry that can be utilized to help record data to achieve accurate counts of the correctly identified species. This will not only assist in providing proof that the fish they caught (and let go) was actually the size they said as well as the species of fish they thought. With the opportunity for this used by both recreational and commercial industries, this can help scientists and regional fisheries management organizations better understand the stocks of many of these pelagic species

Every year 640,000 tons of fishing gear is lost or abandoned in our oceans. This lost gear compromises yields and income for fishermen, trapping fish that are then unavailable for harvest and repopulation, contributing to global food loss and fish stock degradation. It also costs governments and the fishing industry hundreds of millions of dollars annually in recovery, clean-up, lost fishing time, and gear replacement. One of the most horrific impacts of this lost gear is the entanglement of marine wildlife.  Hundreds of thousands of whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, sea turtles, and sea birds are strangled, mutilated, and killed each year due to entrapment in lost gear.  The migratory nature of most wildlife species and the capacity for lost gear to drift cause significant likelihood of entanglement on a global scale. For small-scale fishermen in the developing world, the loss of gear and reduced fish catch impacts their very livelihood. In order to prevent gear loss, the teams that recover lost gear must be able to identify the types of gear that are getting lost and where they come from.

The Bay of Fundy is a vibrant lobster fishing area that provides employment to thousands of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia fishers every year. It is also home to a number of other industries such as those supporting tourism, aquaculture and shipping. A common source of ghost lobster traps and other ghost gear is vessel and gear conflict, where boat traffic from the shipping, aquaculture and fishing industries inadvertently cuts off lobster traps when transiting through fishing grounds. Fundy North has a unique ghost gear retrieval program whereby local fishers, using a specially designed grapple, have removed over 1,000 derelict lobster traps, 23,726 feet of rope, 76 buoys, and other marine waste since 2008. In addition to retrieval, Fundy North is working on protocols to prevent gear and vessel conflict in the first place

There is a lot of data available on the internet about fishing vessels – from pictures of vessels to information about permits and quota; from owner/operator details to unique vessel identifiers. Though all this information exists, it doesn't exist in an integrated, standardized form that law enforcement, like the Coast Guard, can use effectively. This is a problem around the world; at-sea law enforcement teams in the Pacific and Atlantic, and everywhere in between, need a comprehensive, simple way to access all the information they need: vessel name and ID number, owner/operator information, permit types, fishing gear, and much more - in a simple, comprehensive format

Seafood buyers are often deceived with regards to the fish product purchased or consumed. Seafood fraud and mislabeling are unfortunately common in the industry, out of lack of knowledge, weak traceability, or the attempt to sell low value species as higher value ones. Unawareness on the buyers’ end results in uninformed demand of endangered and vulnerable species. This problem affects consumer rights, fair trade, market transparency, and the health of the marine ecosystems. It is widespread in the international realm.  Some countries, like Costa Rica, have implemented an obligatory labeling regulation, but struggle with its effective implementation. Fish commercialization intermediaries and points of sale are challenged with no technical capacity to identify the product they receive from their vendors when it is no longer whole, but cut in fillets. Furthermore, the government inspectors, accountable for the enforcement and verification of the compliance on behalf of the stakeholders along the commercialization chain, also have trouble identifying and validating the species of the fillets

Fisheries port inspectors must be able to identify dozens of fish species that are landed by artisanal and industrial fishing fleets. Many species can be identified easily, while others may be more challenging for non-experts. Lack of technical skills on behalf of the inspectors opens the need to rely on the word of fishermen to identify species or the generation of mistaken landings reports. This lack of capacity on behalf of the market players drags the mistaken identification along the fish commercialization chain in the local market: fishing vessel -> landing site/port -> receiving center -> processor -> distributor -> corporate buyer (i.e.: restaurants, supermarkets, etc.) -> end consumer, and likewise for the export market, which represents approximately 60% of the local catch, mostly through the United States and Europe

A key component for commercial fishing in the U.S. involves fish ticket landings data. This data, which often takes the form of paper fish tickets, identify the type and quantity of fish caught by a given vessel. These data are then migrated (often very painstakingly) to data processing systems that are used to manage the overall fishery. Currently on the west coast of the U.S. for instance, all of the states use different systems with different technical maturities to capture this information. These disparate input systems lead to a significant inefficiencies to include time-consuming, error prone processes

The ASEAN region has the richest biodiversity, the most extensive coastline and most diverse coral reefs in the world. However, it is also one of the most threatened regions in terms of coastal marine resources degradation. The ASEAN region is vast with multiple countries and seas, very large fishing fleets, and very little capacity to monitor fishing vessels in the area. The number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have increased in the region in an effort to protect species such as sharks, turtles, and manta rays, and to protect commercial fish breeding grounds. However, fishing vessels either purposely or accidentally fish in MPAs. Sometimes ships stray into the area accidentally, or at other times the resources the MPAs offer are just too tempting to avoid.  Damage done to the breeding grounds can take years to repair, if it's even possible, costing the region billions of dollars in lost revenue due to depleted stocks

Fish stocks around the world are declining and 90 percent of the world’s fisheries over- or fully exploited. In developing countries like Indonesia, the decline of a fishery has severe consequences, as fishing is a way of life and fish is an important source of protein for millions of people.  In developed countries the status of some fisheries has been improving, but after centuries of over-exploitation it will still take time and effort to recover fish stocks. A key challenge in addressing overfishing is the scarcity of data on the condition of fish stocks.  Some 90% of fisheries globally are lacking stock assessment data. In complex multi-species fisheries, like the ones in Indonesia and in many other tropical developing countries, lack of data on species and size composition of catches makes sound management almost Conventional stock assessment methods are prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, but cost-effective assessment methods based on analysis of the size composition of catches can often address urgent needs.  The problem is that it is difficult to get reliable data on the species and size composition.  Small-scale and recreational fishers land at unpredictable times and they land at remote places.  This makes it almost impossible to get a professional surveyor to the right place at the right time

More than 90% of fisheries in the world, >50% the global catch, lack adequate information to determine stock sustainability. Sustainable fisheries management and stock assessment is constrained the by a lack of timely biological species data. Biologists urgently need more agile approaches to fisheries data collection to enable stock assessments and effective management. The key biological statistics required for stock assessment are derived from the species-by-species measurement of fish lengths to provide population size structure. Traditional approaches to collecting fisheries stock data rely on the manual measurement of individual fish whilst at sea. These approaches require the presence on board fishing vessels of biologists or the use of survey vessels, both of which at are resource intensive and present a significant challenge even in the developed world. The use of cameras on board fishing vessels for compliance and biological monitoring (as replacement for observers) has been tested and the technology exists to collect large numbers of images during normal fishing operations
